    <h2>GradCAM</h2>
    <p>
      GradCAM is a popular visualization technique that highlights important
      regions in a photo for a given model to recognize a certain object (e.g., chair, desk, hornbill).
      In a GradCAM explanation, red regions corresponds to important regions
      (see the colorbar for more information).
      For each photo below, we show GradCAM explanations for three classes.

      For the first photo of a <b>hornbill</b>, which is a type of a bird,
      the model <i>correctly</i> classifies it as a <b>hornbill</b>.
      GradCAM identifies the tip of the beak as the important region for this classification (left heatmap).
      On the other hand, different regions are identified as important for the model
      to <i>incorrectly</i> classify this photo as a <b>panther</b> or a <b>junco bird</b>.

    <p>
      For the second photo of a <b>television</b>, the model <i>incorrectly</i>
      classifies this photo as a <b>tobacco shop</b>.
      According to GradCAM, the important regions for this classification are the
      colorful switches under the television and above the person's head (middle heatmap).
      Again, different regions are identified as important for the model
      to <i>correctly</i> classify this photo as a <b>television</b> or
      <i>incorrectly</i> classify it as a <b>strawberry</b>.
