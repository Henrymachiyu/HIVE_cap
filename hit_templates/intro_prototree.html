  <h2>ProtoTree</h2>
  <p>
    The ProtoTree model reasons with <b>prototypes</b> which are typical representations of
    a feature. For example, pink skinny long legs is a prototype for Flamingos.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ProtoTree model makes decisions in steps following a tree structure.
    Each step in the model contains a prototype learned from a previously seen photo.
    At each step, the model compares a given photo to the step's prototype and rates their
    similarity with a score between 0 and 1. If the similarity score is above 0.5,
    the model judges that the prototype is <b>present</b> in the photo and <b>absent</b> otherwise.
    The model then proceeds to the next step and repeats this process until it reaches the final step.
    <br>
    <br>
    Below we show an example ProtoTree model.
    For the given photo, the model produces a similarity score of 0.23 at Step 1.
    Hence, the model judges that Step 1&#39;s prototype is <b>absent</b> in this photo,
    and moves on to Step 2-a. At Step 2-a, the model produces a similarity score of 0.78 and
    judges that Step 2-a&#39;s prototype is <b>present</b> in this photo.
    The model predicts that the bird in the given photo is <b>Species 2</b>.
    Note that the model never visits Step 2-b.

      Below is the full structure of the model.
      At each step, we show the step&#39;s prototype (left) and the photo where the prototype is from (right).
