    <h1>Choose which model to use</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      The ProtoPNet model achieves an overall accuracy of <b><span id="origacc"></span>%</b> in 200 bird species recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the previous task, 5 of 10 photos were correct predictions and the remaining 5 were incorrect predictions.
      If we assign the 5 predictions with your highest &#34;confident that
      prediction is correct&#34; rating to correct and the rest as incorrect,
      <b>
        you identified <span id="correctcount2"></span> out of <span id="correcttotal2"></span>
        correct predictions and <span id="wrongcount2"></span> out of <span id="wrongtotal2"></span>
        incorrect predictions.
      </b>
      (When there are ties, we randomly assigned some to correct and some to incorrect.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can use a <b>Black-box</b> model that doesn&#39;t come with an explanation of its prediction.

    <h3>Q. What is the minimum accuracy of the Black-box model that would convince you to use the Black-box model over the ProtoPNet model?</h3>
